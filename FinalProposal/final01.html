            Final Proposal: Neo Defender
        </p>

        <p>
            For the final project I came up with several ideas, and ultimately settled on wanting
            to make a game. I wanted to take it a step further and make an API based game. My Idea: 
            Defend Earth from asteroids using NASA's "Asteroid NeoWs" API. There will be a space laser orbiting
            Earth and you have to shoot the asteroids and blow them up.
