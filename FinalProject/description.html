            For my final I wanted to make a game that used data from an API to influence the gameplay.
            So I came up with the idea of making an asteroid defense game using some data from the NASA
            Near Earth Object API. I didn't get to use it too extensively, but I was able to use the data 
            to generate how many asteroids would approach Earth in the next week, and 
            map the number of real asteroids destroyed in game to the number of asteroids generated.
            So by the end of the "week" in the game you've eliminated all of the threats to the Earth.
            After the week is over, you get to play through three bonus rounds. 
            There are three upgrades on the bottom left you can unlock to help beat the game.
