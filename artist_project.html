                                A story created day by day from the start of quarantine and pieced together over time.
                                The story follows an unidentified story teller, basically walking us through their
                                journey through this odd landscape on there way to becoming a tree in a literal sense.

                                is a digital marathon in times of quarantine, 
                                moving forward without really knowing where it's going, 
                                according to the ideas and mood of its author and his technical skills too."

                                Raphaël Bastide challenged himself to code a new chapter of
                                the story every day.

                                until I have a result to the height of what I plan. The next day, 
                                I rediscover what I coded during the night in a sort of frenzy."

                                It was an entertaining and thought provoking series.

                                It really pulled me in and I felt immersed in this strange world.
                                I had little to no Idea where it was going, and every chapter
                                something stranger happened than the last.

                                It was almost like reading a weirder, more random, more unsettling
                                Alice in Wonderland.

                                While the story was a little unsettling, the environment was
                                oddly comforting at times when paired to the simple visuals
                                that had limited color.
